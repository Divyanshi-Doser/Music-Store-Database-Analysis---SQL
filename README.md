# Music-Store-Database-Analysis---SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves deep analysis of a **Music Store database** using **SQL queries**.  
The objective was to extract meaningful insights related to customer behavior, artist popularity, revenue generation, and market trends across different countries and cities.

Through this project, I strengthened my SQL skills, worked with complex queries involving **multiple table joins (up to 11 tables!)**, and tackled real-world data challenges.

## Key Insights and Tasks
- Identify the **senior-most employee** based on job title.
- Find **countries with the highest number of invoices**.
- Discover the **top 3 highest invoice totals**.
- Find the **city with the best customers** (highest revenue).
- Identify the **best customer** (who spent the most).
- Retrieve details of all **Rock music listeners** (email, name, genre).
- Find the **top 10 artists** who wrote the most Rock music tracks.
- List **all tracks longer than the average song length**.
- Calculate **amount spent by each customer on artists**.
- Find the **most popular music genre in each country**.
- Identify the **top customer** by spending for each country.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **Database**: Music Store sample dataset (normalized relational database)

---

## SQL Concepts Applied
- Joins (INNER JOIN, multiple tables)
- Group By and Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Sorting and Filtering (ORDER BY, WHERE)
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Window Functions (`DENSE_RANK()`)
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- String Concatenation for custom fields

---

## Challenges and Learnings
- This was my **first time working with 11 different tables** in one project.
- Initially tricky, but as I understood the relationships, building complex queries became a fun and rewarding experience.
- Improved my understanding of real-world data problems and optimized query writing.

## Conclusion
This project boosted my confidence in SQL and real-world data handling.  
I'm excited to keep learning, take on more challenges, and grow as a data analyst!
